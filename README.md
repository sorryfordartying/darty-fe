  ## Description
  This is an interactive dart board to allow users to keep score during a variety of dart games. There are a large number of unique dart games that all have their own systems for scoring. As dart enthusiasts, these games seem fun but trying to figure out the rules and keep score often proves difficult. In order to open up new possibilities for the casual dart fan, the dart score keeper was created.
